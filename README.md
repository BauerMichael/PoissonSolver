To use the poisson equation solver you have to choices:

1.) download the source files and execute the makefile. Afterwards you get a file named poissonSolver.
Call in your Linux Shell: "./poissonSolver m x k", where m is the parameter to calculate h=1/m. Then
you get N=m-1 grid points in x and y direction. x is the chosen algorithm and k the chosen function.

2.) visit http://homepages.uni-regensburg.de/~bam23651/PoissonSolver and try the website!
