As I set up my famous equation I couldn't know, that there will be some mathematics which learn to solve the discretisized equation with the computer only in a few steps.<br>So, at this point I want to thank Mr. Magnus Hestenes and Mr. Eduard Stiefel who invented Conjugate Gradient Method. With this very mighty tool the discretisized Poisson Equation is just a tiny thing to compute. So, enjoy this website and the PoissonSolver which is implemented in C++.<br><br>PS: For further Information about me, click the picture on the right.
